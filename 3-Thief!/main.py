# Thief!

# A thief has managed to find out the four digits for an online PIN code, but doesnâ€™t know the correct sequence needed to hack into the account.
# Design and write a program that displays all the possible combinations for any four numerical digits entered by the user. The program should avoid displaying the same
# combination more than once.
