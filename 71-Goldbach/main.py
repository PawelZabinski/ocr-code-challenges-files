# Goldbach

# Goldbachâ€™s conjecture says that every positive even number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers. Example: 28 = 5 + 23. It is one of the most famous facts in number
# theory that has not been proved to be correct in the general case. It has been numerically confirmed up to very large.
# Write a predicate to find the two prime numbers that sum up to a given even integer.
